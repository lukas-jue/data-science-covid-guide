# Learning Data Science with the Coronavirus Data

This repository contains the detailed project guide for [TechAcademy](tech-academy.io) students in the summer term 2020.
Check out the full website here: [Data Science Project Guide: Covid-19](https://lukas-jue.github.io/data-science-covid-guide/)

Our students learn how to handle the most recent COVID-19 data in Python and R.
With the help of this project guide and their personal mentors, they learn how to code pretty
data visualizations and use models for predictions of the daily new infections.
For the first time, we've developed our detailed project guide as an easy-to-use website.
Students can also download a printable PDF version straight from this website.
